# Multi-Vendor eCommerce Platform

## Overview

This project is a multi-vendor eCommerce platform built using modern Java technologies, including Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate, and Redis. The platform leverages a MySQL database with Flyway integration for seamless migrations and version control of the schema.
